# Design Choices and Implementation Overview
**Component Library**: For the component library, I chose Material-UI. It provides a clean and modern design, along with a wide range of customizable components. Its detailed documentation made it easy to implement and get up to speed with the library.

**State Management**: To handle the state of the application, especially for the cart, I used Redux. It helps manage complex state changes in a predictable way, and is a good fit for applications that require centralized state management.

**Persistence**: I integrated redux-persist to ensure that the cart data persists even after page reloads. By whitelisting the cart reducer, I store the cart selections in localStorage, so users donâ€™t lose their cart items if they refresh or navigate away from the page.

**Animations**: To enhance the user experience, I used Framer Motion to add smooth animations to the product cards. This creates a more dynamic and engaging interface, making interactions feel more polished.

**Cart View**: The cart is displayed using a Drawer component, which provides a clean, responsive side panel for users to view and modify their cart. I also used React-Toastify to show snack bar notifications for actions like adding or removing items, giving users clear feedback on their interactions.

**API Data Fetching**: For fetching data from the API, I created a small custom hook with Axios. This allows me to reuse the data-fetching logic throughout the app, keeping the codebase clean and modular.

**Overall Design**: My goal with the design was to keep things simple and intuitive. The folder structure follows best practices for scalability, and I focused on creating reusable components to ensure that the code is maintainable in the long run.
